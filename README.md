# Bootstrap Card

This project is practice in creating native web components and styling with Bootstrap.

## How It Works

The class <i>Books</i> is generated in the <b>book.js</b> file which displays one of Bootstrap's simple component card templates. <i>Books</i> is defined as the custom element <i>mit-book</i>.

The new element is picked up in <b>index.js</b> as well as the data within <b>books.json</b>, which contains the title, author and brief description of the top five best selling books of 2021 according to the NY Times. 

## What's Next...

Moving forward, I plan to use a larger set of data and generate local links so that one can search a book reference and jump to it's content.
